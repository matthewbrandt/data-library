# Data Library Component: Card

Cards contain content and (potential) actions about a single subject or topic.

**N.B. Interactions within cards themselves are governed by the individual action type (e.g. a toggle will be under the Selection Controls component). Card events only concern interactions with the Card itself.**

# Component Events
## Card Select
A select event is when a card is interacted with.

## Card Flip
A flip event is when a card is flipped to the opposite side.

## Card State
The state event is when the display of the card is changed in any way (e.g. expanding or collapsing content).
