# Data Library Component: Button

Buttons can be selected by the user to take the user to a different destination (in or out of view range). Buttons can also be floating/hovering above elements and can provide a context menu to interact with multiple options. Buttons do not need to be in a classic rectangle shape either.

# Component Events
## Button Select
When the button is selected and released again.

## Button Hold
When the button is selected, but not released immediately (within a set period of time).
