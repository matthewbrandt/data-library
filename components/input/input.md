# Data Library Component: Input

Any input fields not found within a search component are considered as an input component.

# Component Events
## Input Exit
When the user exits an input text field (by clicking/interacting elsewhere).

**N.B. Since the Input Exit could contain confidential or private information, the label is set to the actual title of the input field itself, e.g. “email” or “height_cm”.**
